_____ PROJECT _________________________________________________________

Extension of Navier-Stokes from worksheet 3 by
* transport of temperature (w/ Boussinesq approx. for Navier-Stokes)
* transport of chemical substances
* chemical reactions of substances

Our project simulates continuous flows using the Navier-Stokes model.
In this project, the previously implemented model was extended to take
the influence of heat into account. This is performed using the
Boussinesq approximation, which neglects changes in density.
The temperature differences directly result in the buoyancy force.
The project also models transport (i.e., diffusion and convection) of
an arbitrary number of chemical substances.
These substances, together with their reaction coefficients, are defined
inside the configuration files for the different scenarios. The initial
distribution of these substances can be defined as a constant value over
the whole domain or with the aid of a PGM-file.


_____ REQUIREMENTS ____________________________________________________


____COMPILER____

This code uses C++11 features and therefore needs a recent compiler!
It will work with g++ 4.6, but won't for all previous version of g++.


____LIBRARIES____

The following boost header files have been used:
    boost/property_tree/xml_parser.hpp
    boost/algorithm/string.hpp
    boost/lexical_cast.hpp
    boost/optional.hpp
    boost/property_tree/ptree.hpp
    boost/algorithm/string/replace.hpp

On Debian or Ubuntu flavoured machines they are available via the
"libboost-dev" package.

The functions used are header-only library functions, and won't need
any additional runtime files.



____DEMO_PLATFORM____

Don't want to install those two packages? We've set up a demo system
for your convenience:

ssh -p 2255 demo@demo.bstegmaier.de
password: tumcfddemo
directory: project

Please remember to use an uppercase -P when specifying the port with
sftp or scp. E.g.:
scp -P 2255 demo@demo.bstegmaier.de:project/*vtk .



_____ SCENARIOS _______________________________________________________

* Rayleigh–Bénard convection

  Run with: ./sim rayleigh_benard.xml

  A shallow/wide container, filled with a fluid at ambient temperature
  (e.g. T=0), is heated from below (Dirichlet, e.g. T=5) and has a
  fixed ambient temperature at the top (Dirichlet, e.g. T=0). The
  lateral walls are isolated (Neumann).
  In addition, there is a small drop of another fluid inside the
  container.

  What you should see:
  The initially produced temperature layering is unstable and soon the
  flow evolves in regular, contra-rotating convection cells. In the
  example provided, those patterns will be stable after some period of
  time.
  The added substance can be seen to move with the flow. It is being
  slowly transported from cell to cell, which suggests, that there is
  some exchange of fluid among them.


* Flow in a pipe with an obstacle. Multiple reactions

  Run with: ./sim mixing.xml

  A pipe with a single obstacle. Fluid with T=0 is injected with a parabollic 
  profile such that, without the chemical reactions, it produces vorticity.
  At the right we have outflow conditions. All boundaries are isolated
  for both temperature and concentrations. We introduce substances s0, s1, s3.
  We have two reactions: s1 and s2 react to form s2, then, s3 and s2 react to
  form s1 and s4.

  What you should see:
  As the reagents are placed in the pipe, they start to react. Heat production
  caused by the reactions changes the usual flow pattern. The oscillations
  move down and are diminished, while hot fluid goes to the ceiling and forms
  a vortices.
